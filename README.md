# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales performance, regional trends, and customer behavior using the Superstore dataset.  
I used a combination of Tableau Public, and Python to extract insights and present data visually.

## Technologies Used

- Tableau Public ‚Äî for interactive dashboards

-  Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) ‚Äî for extended analysis

## Project Description

The Superstore dataset contains detailed information on sales, profit, region, product categories, and customer segments.  
In this project, I analyzed key business metrics to identify trends and performance gaps.

It combines dashboard storytelling with hands-on spreadsheet analytics.
